I am an undergraduate researcher at the [CAR3S](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/CARS.html) research group at IIT Kanpur working with [Biswa](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/). My research interests mainly lie in computer architecture and developing secure memory hierarchies. I'll be applying for grad school next semester.

I've also had the good fortune of working with other amazing professors like [Dr. Kanad Basu](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/kanad-basu) and [Dr. Debadatta Mishra](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/deba/). I'll be spending 13 weeks of my upcoming summer at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, working with [Dr. Ramesh Karri](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/ramesh-karri), as a research intern.

Apart from my academic endeavours, I love to read fiction, especially written by 19th century European authors. I absolutely adore the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Bram Stoker, Mary Shelly and Jane Austen.
