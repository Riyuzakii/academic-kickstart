abstract: Signature and behavior-based anti-virus systems (AVS) are traditionally used to detect Malware. However, these AVS fail to catch metamorphic and polymorphic Malware - which can reconstruct themselves every generation or every instance. We introduce two Machine learning (ML) approaches on system state + instruction sequences --which use hardware debug data -- to detect such challenging  Malware. Our experiments on hundreds of  Intel Malware samples show that the techniques either alone or jointly  detect Malware with >= 99.5\% accuracy.
