**TL;DR** 
This post summarizes my experience at ISCA'19, presenting a paper as an undergrad, at the [HASP](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/workshops/hasp2019/program.html) workshop titled, _"Reverse Engineering the Stream Prefetcher For Profit."_


I started working with Biswa (and Prakhar) in December of 2018, on a project to find and exploit a new microarchitectural-side channel. I continued the project during the 'Computer Architecture' course that I took with Biswa in my 6th semester. While the whole project itself was quite long and difficult, we managed to reverse engineer one of the hardware prefetchers present on the Intel chips. We compiled the results into a paper and submitted it to the HASP workshop at ISCA'19. Part of the reason to submit the paper to HASP was also to give me a chance to attend a conference like ISCA, as I was anyway going to be in the US, during the conference, for my internship. On the day that we were supposed to receive the acceptance notification, Biswa and I were discussing why it hadn't come yet, on slack. And we received the information during the discussion itself. A lot of boring stuff happened after that....and then we landed in Phoenix.


Now, I had had a lot of advice on what and how to do something at the conference, but I'm just going to leave [this](https://uarch2019.github.io/uarch2019/first_time_attendee_faq) here for reference. We reached Phoenix a day before the workshops were to start. The unique thing about ISCA'19 was that it was a part of FCRC (Federated Computing Research Conference), which is the co-location of various conferences (13 this year, hence the title) that happens every few years. I was initially really disappointed when I didn't get an ISCA t-shirt (how else do you let people know that you were at ISCA :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:), but they gave us some other pretty cool stuff. My presentation was on Sunday, so I was free for all workshops on Saturday. There was an excellent [tutorial](https://sites.google.com/view/arch-sec/home) on Side/Covert-channel attacks by a team from UIUC & UT-Austin.


Another extraordinary thing about ISCA'19 was [uArch](https://uarch2019.github.io/uarch2019/) mentoring workshop.
In this workshop, they invited selected individuals interested in architecture (pre-final/final year undergrads and first-year grad students) from around the globe (all expenses covered) for encouraging them to pursue research in computer architecture.
I applied to this workshop and didn't get selected, but since I was going to be there anyway, I signed up for it. 
Now, back to Saturday; after the workshop, there was a dinner for all uArch attendees, arranged by Microsoft. There I met a lot of undergrads and grad students from other universities (Cornell, Stony brooks, Duke, etc.). I was amazed to find out about the kind of work some of them were doing, as were they when I talked about my projects. There we also some professors and many people from companies like Microsoft, Google, and Baidu. We had a great discussion about grad-schools and research in general compared to the kind of research that goes on in the industry.


The next day, I was a bit stiff from nervousness. I had my presentation at 2 PM, so I had some time to get myself comfortable in the environment. I spent most of the morning session in uArch, but I also attended Biswa's talk in DPC3 (which he and Samuel won, btw). After lunch, I came back early to set my laptop and practice while the room was empty. My presentation went alright, there's always scope for improvement and even more so since this my first time presenting at any conference.

Although my presentation collided with Dr. David Patterson's talk in uArch, so I missed some of that. Then there was a talk on DNA as storage systems, which was cutting-edge. Sunday evening was also the reception of ISCA which, due to FCRC, started with 2019's Turing lecture (by Yann Lecun and Geoffrey Hinton). That night, there was a dinner at a bowling alley nearby for ISCA attendees (with free drinks and bowling ofc).

The main program started on Monday morning. From Monday morning, all sponsors (Microsoft, FB, Google, to name a few) of the event had their stalls up with free goodies and internship/job opportunities. Depending on your taste, you might like one or both of them; I was more interested in the goodies :wink:). There were interesting papers on all three days, and one can learn a lot about their research by listening about other people's work and approach. But since the papers will be different every year, I'll leave it as an exercise for the reader to figure out what talks to attend when they plan on attending a conference.
Till Monday morning, I had only interacted with other students but here comes the best part of the conference (according to me). ISCA also has a 'Meet A Senior Architect' program, where you have to provide eight choices, in order of preference, for people you might want to meet. These people are professors or researchers from industry, who'll be your mentor if matched to you, then you get to spend 30 to 40 minutes to talk to them. I got a mentor from my list, and it was a fantastic experience talking to him. We talked about his research, my research, life in academia, grad schools, grad school applications, and other things. And the fact that a professor of his stature would give some of his valuable time to talk to an undergrad boosted my confidence. After that, I spoke to a lot of other professors who worked in the areas I was interested in and took their opinion on my research. I also told almost all of them that I was going to apply for grad school next semester, and they encouraged me to apply to their lab. 


On the 2nd day, there was a complete session on security, which was also quite interesting. After attending some more talks that I found interesting in the afternoon session, I went hiking in the foothills of Camelback mountain(:wink:) with some seniors from IITK who were attending other conferences, part of FCRC.  That was also an excellent opportunity to interact with seniors in research fields, different from my own although I wouldn't recommend going for trekking across desert mountains at 330 PM unless you like scorching heat or diamondback rattlesnakes.

ISCA had also arranged an excursion for all attendees to the Musical Instrument Museum of Phoenix (which, according to Wikipedia, is the largest museum of its type in the world). It had musical instruments from around, and there was a separate collection that you could play. For the main collection, we received wireless headsets, which played the instrument closest to you. (Coolness 100, 11/10 would recommend). On the final day, ISCA only had talks in the first half, so we didn't even get free lunch that day (:cry:). And that was the end of my first ISCA. 


Attending ISCA as an undergrad was a great experience, that I wish everyone had. If you're confused about research or industry, then attending a top conference in your field will help with that decision. 
The most cutting edge research in computer architecture from around was probably there at ISCA, how can one not get inspired to contribute to it? I'll try to attend the next ISCA, for sure. Hopefully, I'll see you there. 
The trip and the project was fully sponsored by IITK, SRC, and NXP, so thumbs up for that. And lastly, a big thanks to Biswa for guiding me along the way. The bottom line is that doing good research is very cool. Indeed, because at the very least you get to travel around the world for free.
